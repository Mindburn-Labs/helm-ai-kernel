# Receipts

Every governed action should leave a local record. For public HELM, that record
is the proof path: show what was proposed, what HELM decided, why it decided
that, and where the receipt was written.

## What Gets Written

For MCP and boundary decisions, HELM records:

- `decision_id`
- verdict: `ALLOW`, `DENY`, or `ESCALATE`
- reason code
- server id, tool name, and effect scope when available
- receipt path
- approval hint when a credential-verified admission path is available
- policy epoch and record hash

Approvals and revocations also write receipts. A later evaluation must fail
closed when an admission is expired, revoked, or outside its server, tool, or
effect scope.

## Inspect Local Receipts

```bash
helm-ai-kernel mcp receipts --json
helm-ai-kernel mcp pending --json
helm-ai-kernel boundary records --json
helm-ai-kernel receipts status --format json
helm-ai-kernel receipts list --format json
```

For a Kernel evaluate `receipt.v5` file copied off-box (Foundation/offline
verify, not AI OS live, not #859, not self-attested EvidencePack):

```bash
helm-ai-kernel verify receipt \
  --receipt <receipt.v5.json> \
  --trusted-public-key-file <expected-ed25519.pub>
```

Exit 0 only when integrity and signer trust both hold against the
caller-supplied key. Hop fixtures are labeled DENY / no permit.

For a single workstation receipt:

```bash
helm-ai-kernel workstation verify-decision \
  --receipt ~/.helm-ai-kernel/receipts/hooks/wpd_<decision>.json
```

This workstation command reports `integrity` and `trusted` independently.
`integrity: true` alone only means the contents match the receipt's declared
public key. A zero exit status requires `trusted: true` against the expected
local key or an explicit `--trusted-public-key-file`; use the latter for a
receipt copied between machines.

For an EvidencePack:

```bash
helm-ai-kernel verify evidence-pack.tar
```

Compatibility form:

```bash
helm-ai-kernel verify --bundle evidence-pack.tar
```

Offline verification is the default. If a pack has no public anchor, HELM
reports that directly; it does not invent one.

## Read A Decision

Start with these fields:

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `decision_id` | The decision to cite when debugging or rerunning |
| `verdict` | `ALLOW`, `DENY`, or `ESCALATE` |
| `reason_code` | Why the boundary returned that verdict |
| `receipt_path` | Local file written for the decision |
| `record_hash` | Tamper-evidence handle for the boundary record |

An `ESCALATE` receipt is not permission to continue. Obtain a
credential-verified durable dispatch admission for the exact scope, then
rerun the original action so HELM evaluates it again. Local `mcp approve`
does not mint that authority.

## Export Evidence

Use an EvidencePack when you need to move proof material between machines or
review it later:

```bash
helm-ai-kernel evidence export \
  --receipts ~/.helm-ai-kernel/receipts \
  --out evidence-pack.tar

helm-ai-kernel verify evidence-pack.tar
```

EvidencePacks are portable proof bundles for local review and offline replay.

## Release Evidence

Current source release target: `v0.8.5`.

The `v0.8.5` release is complete only after the listed local verification
assets appear on the GitHub release and verify locally.

Check the GitHub release and local verification artifacts together:

- release: `https://github.com/Mindburn-Labs/helm-ai-kernel/releases/tag/v0.8.5`
- v0.8.5 Asset Contract
- `v0.8.5.openvex.json`
- `v0.8.5.json`

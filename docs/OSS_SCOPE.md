# HELM OSS Scope

> **Canonical architecture**: see [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) for the

HELM OSS is the **open execution kernel** of the HELM stack.

It exists to keep the deterministic boundary small, portable, and independently trustworthy. The commercial HELM layers must extend this kernel, not replace it.

## Kernel TCB (Trusted Computing Base)

The canonical TCB is bounded to **8 packages** — the minimal trusted core.
See [TCB_POLICY.md](TCB_POLICY.md) for the authoritative package list,
expansion criteria, and CI enforcement details.

## Active OSS Packages

The following packages are part of the OSS kernel, including both TCB and
non-TCB supporting infrastructure:

### TCB Packages

## Removed from TCB (Enterprise)

The following packages were removed to minimize the attack surface:

| Package                    | Reason                        |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------- |

| `cockpit/`                 | UI dashboard                  |
| `ops/`                     | Operations tooling            |
| `multiregion/`             | Multi-region orchestration    |
| `hierarchy/`               | Enterprise hierarchy          |

| `perimeter/`               | Network perimeter             |

## First-Class Execution Surfaces

### MCP Interceptor

The MCP gateway (`core/pkg/mcp/`) is a **first-class governed surface**,
not an adapter. It provides:

- Tool discovery with governance metadata (`/mcp/v1/capabilities`)
- Governed tool execution with signed receipts (`/mcp/v1/execute`)
- Schema validation against pinned tool contracts
- Full ProofGraph integration — MCP calls produce the same receipt chain
  as OpenAI proxy calls

### OpenAI-Compatible Proxy

The governed proxy (`/v1/chat/completions`) intercepts OpenAI-compatible
tool calls and routes them through the PEP boundary.

### Bounded-Surface Primitives

The OSS kernel includes configurable surface containment primitives
(see [CAPABILITY_MANIFESTS.md](CAPABILITY_MANIFESTS.md)):

- Domain-scoped tool bundles
- Explicit capability manifests
- Read-only / write-limited / side-effect-class profiles
- Connector allowlists
- Destination scoping
- Filesystem/network deny-by-default (WASI)
- Sandbox profile requirement per tool class

## Boundary Truth

OSS includes:

- **Surface containment** — capability manifests, tool bundles, sandbox profiles
- **Dispatch enforcement** — fail-closed PEP, policy evaluation, budget gates
- **Verifiable receipts** — signed receipts, ProofGraph, replay
- **MCP interceptor** — first-class governed MCP surface
- **OpenAI proxy** — governed proxy for OpenAI-compatible SDKs
- Adapters and integration surfaces

OSS does not include:

- Surface Design Studio (policy UI)
- Policy rollout / staging / shadow enforcement
- Certified connector program
- Managed federation
- Pack distribution and entitlements
- Compliance intelligence workflows
- Mission Control / Studio operations surfaces
- Enterprise evidence retention / legal hold
- Managed control plane and team operations

The invariant is simple: OSS must stay fully useful on its own. The commercial layer monetizes shared organizational control around the kernel, not artificial runtime crippleware.
